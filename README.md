About: This project is about showing the football teams and the details of a specific team.
->Practicing: React Router, ReactBootstrap, Font Awesome.

#Problem
->De structuring wasn't working properly(error-map isnt a function). I have spent 1 and a half day just to figure out the problem. Then somehow managed the project. That's why the dynamic social media link is missing.
